This project is a partner project. 

We chose a dataset from Lending Club (www.lendingclub.com). LendingClub is an American peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.

The purpose of the project is to use machine learning models and insights from exploratory data analysis in order to help Lending CLub investors to decide whom to support with a loan. That is, the risk of losing money by supporting borrowers who will end up not paying back is to be minimized. The problem is treated as a binary classification problem (positive = borrower paying back, negative = borrower not paying back).

Thus, the main convern is to avoid approving somebody who won't be able to repay. Therefore, the main performance metrics of our models are precision and recall scores as well as the F beta score combining both measures with a greater weight on precision (since it is particularly bad to classify a 'non-payer' as 'payer', i.e., false positive). 

Since the data is imbalanced with regard to target variable class frequencies, we pay much attention to handling this imbalance. Also, the data needed much preprocessing.
